Windows portable release
........................

There is a portable Windows zip file. It should be unziped into a new empty
folder (for example c:\\GeoEasy). 
If you would like to export to GPX or KML format, set up an environment
variable *PROJ_LIB* to the root directory of GeoEasy.

.. code::

	setx PROJ_LIB=C:\GeoEasy

Linux Installation (Ubuntu)
---------------------------

Prerequisites
.............

Install tcl/tk on your platform (https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/)

.. code:: bash

	sudo apt-get install tcl tk

Install proj (https://proj4.org)

.. code:: bash

	sudo apt-get install proj-bin

Install GNU Gama (https://www.gnu.org/software/gama/)
There is no binary package for Ubuntu, make it from source.

Install Triangle (https://github.com/MrPhil/Triangle)

.. code:: bash

	sudo apt-get install triangle-bin

Debian package
..............

There is a Debian package for Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions which can be downloaded from
http://digikom.hu/english/geo_easy_e.html, it is a standard Debian package (geoeasy*version*-wheezy_all.deb). You can use the package manager to install it (right click on the file in the file manager or use dpkg)

.. code:: bash

	sudo dpkg -i geoeasy*version*-wheezy_all.deb

To start GeoEasy select it from the menu or type in the terminal window:

.. code:: bash

	geoeasy

The Debian install package was created by https://github.com/zvezdochiot.

Ubuntu binary release
.....................

There is a compressed Linux binary release which can be downloaded from
http://digikom.hu/english/geo_easy_e.html, it is a simple tar-gzip (Gizi*version*Linux.tgz) file. 
The following commands have to be executed (it is supposed the tgz file is 
downloaded into your home directory):

.. code:: bash

	mkdir GeoEasy
	cd GeoEasy
	tar xvzf ../Gizi3xxLinux.tgz

.. .note:
	the name of the tgz file is changed release by release, you can find 
	development (alfa/beta) releases e.g. Gizi303devLinux.tgz

You can start GeoEasy from the installation directory using the command:

.. code:: bash

	cd ~/GeoEasy
	./GeoEasy

You can create a shell script file to start GeoEasy from any directory.

.. code:: bash

	pushd ~/GeoEasy
	./GeoEasy
	popd

Copy this file into a directory on the PATH.

Install source release (Ubuntu)
...............................

Download the source files from GitHub (github.com/zsiki/GeoEasy) either
the zip file or *git clone* the repository. If you would like to update your
version regularly, then the *git clone* should be prefered.

.. code:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/zsiki/GeoEasy.git

Change directory to **GeoEasy/src** and
run the following commands from the command line, to prepare it.

.. code:: bash

	cd GeoEasy/src
	make source
	chmod +x geo_easy.tcl

Make a symbolic link from the GeoEasy/src directory to the external programs.

.. code:: bash

	cd GeoEasy/src
	ln -s /usr/bin/cs2cs cs2cs
	ln -s /usr/local/bin/gama-local gama-local
	ln -s /usr/bin/triangle triangle

Alternatively you can change the path to these programs in the geo\_easy.msk file. 

.. code:: tcl

	set gamaProg {/usr/local/bin/gama-local/gama-local}
	...
	set triangleProg {/usr/bin/triangle}
	...
	set cs2csProg {/usr/bin/cs2cs}

Or if the commands are on the PATH input only the name of the commands in the 
geo_easy.msk file.

.. code:: tcl

	set gamaProg {gama-local}
	...
	set triangleProg {triangle}
	...
	set cs2csProg {cs2cs}

.. note::

 	The path to the external program may be different, depending on 
	your settings and Linux distro.

To start the program use the following command from the **src** directory:

.. code:: bash

	cd GeoEasy/src
	wish geo_easy.tcl

or

.. code:: bash

	cd GeoEasy/src
	./geo_easy.tcl

To update to the actual master on GitHub simply *git pull* it, from the GeoEasy
directory.

.. code:: bash

	cd GeoEasy
	git pull

The preparation should be repeated (make source).
